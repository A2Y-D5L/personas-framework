## Framework Setup

### New Project Setup

For projects starting from scratch with the Personas Framework:

#### Step 1: Initialize Project Structure

```bash
# Create your new project directory
mkdir my-new-project && cd my-new-project

# Initialize git if needed
git init

# Clone the framework or copy from existing installation
git clone https://github.com/A2Y-D5L/personas-framework.git .personas-framework

# Run the setup script
./.personas-framework/setup.sh
```

#### Step 2: Project Configuration

```bash
# Edit project metadata
nano .personas/project/README.md

# Define technical specifications
nano .personas/project/TECH-SPEC.md

# Set coding standards
nano .personas/project/STANDARDS.md

# Configure dependencies
nano .personas/project/DEPENDENCIES.md
```

#### Step 3: Customize Persona Contexts

```bash
# Customize Engineer context for your tech stack
nano .personas/project/contexts/engineer/IMPLEMENTATION-PATTERNS.md

# Add Planner context for your architecture
nano .personas/project/contexts/planner/ARCHITECTURE-PATTERNS.md

# Configure Reviewer criteria
nano .personas/project/contexts/reviewer/REVIEW-CRITERIA.md

# Set up Agent-Manager coordination
nano .personas/project/contexts/agent-manager/COORDINATION-PATTERNS.md
```

#### Step 4: Initial Task Creation

```bash
# Create your first planning task
cat > .personas/project/todos/planner/current/project-initialization.md << 'EOF'
# Project Architecture Planning

```

### Existing Project Integration

For adding the framework to existing codebases:

#### Step 1: Assessment and Preparation

```bash
# Navigate to your existing project
cd /path/to/existing/project

# Backup your project (recommended)
git stash push -m "Before Personas Framework integration"

# Ensure clean working directory
git status
```

#### Step 2: Safe Integration

```bash
# Download framework to temporary location
git clone https://github.com/A2Y-D5L/personas-framework.git /tmp/personas-framework

# Run setup with existing project flag
/tmp/personas-framework/setup.sh $(pwd) --existing-project

# The script will:
# - Detect existing project structure
# - Avoid conflicts with existing files
# - Create .personas/ directory safely
# - Preserve your existing workflow
```

#### Step 3: Gradual Adoption Strategy

**Phase 1: Documentation and Planning**
```bash
# Start with documentation tasks
echo "# Existing Project Analysis

**Created:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned:** Planner

## Objective
Analyze existing project structure and plan framework integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Current architecture documented

3. Create detailed engineering tasks
4. Define acceptance criteria
5. Prepare handoff to Engineer

## Phase 2: Implementation (Engineer Persona)  
@workspace /attach .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

You are now the Engineer persona. Please:
1. Review the planning work from Phase 1
2. Implement the notification system
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Handle error scenarios
5. Prepare handoff to Reviewer

## Phase 3: Quality Review (Reviewer Persona)
@workspace /attach .personas/framework/personas/reviewer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

You are now the Reviewer persona. Please:
1. Review the implementation from Phase 2
2. Assess code quality and security
3. Validate test coverage
4. Provide improvement recommendations
5. Approve or request changes
```

**Engineer → Reviewer Code Review Cycle**

```markdown
# Code Review Workflow

## Engineer Submission
@workspace /attach .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Engineer persona: You've completed the user authentication feature.
Please prepare a review package including:
- Implementation summary
- Test results
- Performance analysis
- Security considerations
- Documentation updates

## Reviewer Analysis
@workspace /attach .personas/framework/personas/reviewer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Reviewer persona: Please conduct a comprehensive review:
- Code quality assessment
- Security vulnerability analysis  
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Test coverage validation
- Standards compliance check

Provide specific recommendations and approval status.

## Engineer Response
[Switch back to Engineer persona]
Address the reviewer feedback and implement recommended changes.
```

### Advanced Patterns

#### Dynamic Persona Switching

**Context-Aware Switching:**
```markdown
# Intelligent Persona Selection

## Scenario: Complex Feature Development

### Current Question: "How should we implement caching for the API?"

**Analysis:**
- If focused on system design → Switch to Planner persona
- If focused on implementation details → Switch to Engineer persona  
- If focused on performance analysis → Switch to Reviewer persona

### Auto-Switch Prompt:
Based on this question about caching implementation, which persona should handle this?

1. Planner: For architectural decisions about caching strategy
2. Engineer: For technical implementation of caching logic
3. Reviewer: For performance analysis of caching effectiveness

Please assume the appropriate persona and proceed.
```

#### Context Management Strategies

**Progressive Context Loading:**
```markdown
# Phase 1: Core Identity (Small context)
You are the [Persona] from the Personas Framework.
Key responsibilities: [Brief summary]

# Phase 2: Project Context (Medium context)  
Project tech stack: [Tech details]
Current sprint goals: [Sprint objectives]

# Phase 3: Specific Task (Full context)
Current task: [Complete task description]
Previous work: [Related context]
Dependencies: [External factors]

# Phase 4: Deep Dive (On-demand)
Detailed specs: [Load if needed]
Historical decisions: [Load if needed]
Performance data: [Load if needed]
```

**Context Refresh Patterns:**
```markdown
# Context Refresh Checkpoint

## Current Status Check
Are you still operating as the [Persona] persona?
Do you remember your current task: [Task summary]?
Are there any context elements you need refreshed?

## Context Revalidation
Please confirm:
- Your persona identity and responsibilities
- The current task objective
- Key project constraints
- Previous decisions that affect this work

## Continue Work
Proceed with the task using refreshed context.
```

#### Error Handling and Recovery

**Persona Re-assumption:**
```markdown
# Recovery Protocol

## Situation: Agent seems to have lost persona context

### Step 1: Identity Recovery
You are the [Persona] persona from the Personas Framework.
[Re-attach persona instructions]

### Step 2: Context Recovery  
Your current task: [Restate task]
Previous progress: [Summarize work done]
Next steps: [What needs to happen]

### Step 3: Validation
Please confirm:
- You understand your persona role
- You remember the current task
- You can continue from where we left off

### Step 4: Resume
Continue with the task using your persona protocols.
```

**Task Scope Clarification:**
```markdown
# Scope Boundary Enforcement

## When Engineer tries to do architecture:
"That's a Planner persona responsibility. Let me create a handoff task for architecture decisions."

## When Planner tries to implement:
"That's an Engineer persona responsibility. I'll create specific implementation tasks."

## When anyone tries to coordinate:
"That's an Agent-Manager persona responsibility. Let me escalate for coordination."

## Handoff Creation:
Create appropriate tasks in the target persona's todo directory.
```

---

## Validation and Testing

### Framework Structure Validation

**Automated Validation Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-framework.sh

echo "🔍 Validating Personas Framework Installation..."

# Check framework structure
if [ ! -d ".personas/framework" ]; then
    echo "❌ Framework directory missing"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -d ".personas/project" ]; then
    echo "❌ Project directory missing"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate core persona files
for persona in engineer planner reviewer agent-manager; do
    if [ ! -f ".personas/framework/personas/$persona/INSTRUCTIONS.md" ]; then
        echo "❌ Missing $persona instructions"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Check project customization
if [ ! -f ".personas/project/README.md" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Project README not customized"
fi

# Validate todo structure
for persona in engineer planner reviewer agent-manager; do
    for dir in current backlog in-progress changes-requested completed; do
        if [ ! -d ".personas/project/todos/$persona/$dir" ]; then
            echo "❌ Missing todo directory: $persona/$dir"
            exit 1
        fi
    done
done

echo "✅ Framework structure validation passed"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### Issue: Permission Denied During Setup

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ mkdir: cannot create directory '.personas': Permission denied
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check current directory permissions
ls -la

# Ensure you have write permissions
chmod u+w .

# Try setup with explicit permissions
mkdir -p .personas
chmod -R u+w .personas

# Alternative: Run setup from parent directory
cd ..
./personas-framework/setup.sh ./my-project
```

#### Issue: Framework Files Not Found

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ File not found: .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify framework was copied correctly
ls -la .personas/framework/

# Re-run setup script
./setup.sh --force

# Manual framework copy
cp -r /path/to/personas-framework/framework .personas/

# Validate file integrity
find .personas/framework -name "*.md" -exec echo "Found: {}" \;
```

#### Issue: AI Agent Can't Load Context

**Symptoms:**
- Agent doesn't understand persona role
- Context attachment fails
- "File not found" errors in AI platform

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check file paths are correct
ls -la .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Verify file content is readable
head -20 .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Test with absolute paths
pwd
# Use full path: /full/path/to/project/.personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Check file size for context limits
wc -c .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md
```

### Integration Problems

#### Issue: Context Window Exceeded

**Symptoms:**
- AI platform truncates context
- Agent loses persona identity mid-conversation
- "Context too large" errors

**Solutions:**
```markdown
# Strategy 1: Progressive Loading
Load core persona identity first, then add context incrementally.

# Strategy 2: Context Summarization
Create condensed versions of persona instructions for limited platforms.

# Strategy 3: Context Prioritization
Load only essential context for current task.
```

**Context Compression Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# compress-context.sh

# Create condensed persona instructions
echo "# Engineer Persona (Condensed)

**Role:** Implementation and debugging
**Focus:** Code, tests, optimization, troubleshooting

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Write and modify code
- Create tests and debug issues  
- Optimize performance
- Handle error scenarios

**Boundaries:**
- NO architecture decisions (→ Planner)
- NO code reviews (→ Reviewer)
- NO coordination (→ Agent-Manager)

**Workflow:**
1. Review task requirements
2. Implement with tests
3. Validate and document
4. Handoff to Reviewer
" > .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS-CONDENSED.md
```

#### Issue: Persona Context Confusion

**Symptoms:**
- Agent takes on responsibilities outside persona scope
- Persona boundaries are ignored
- Wrong handoff patterns

**Solutions:**
```markdown
# Explicit Boundary Reinforcement
"Remember: As the Engineer persona, you focus only on implementation. 
Architecture decisions should be handed off to the Planner persona."

# Regular Identity Checks
"Please confirm: What is your persona role and what are its boundaries?"

# Corrective Prompting
"That's outside your persona scope. Please create a handoff task for the appropriate persona."
```

### Performance Issues

#### Issue: Slow Context Loading

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Optimize file sizes
find .personas -name "*.md" -size +10k -exec echo "Large file: {}" \;

# Use .gitignore for unnecessary files
echo "*.tmp
*.log
.DS_Store" >> .personas/.gitignore

# Compress images and assets
# Use markdown instead of heavy file formats
```

#### Issue: Task Management Overhead

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Automated task templates
cat > .personas/tools/new-task.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
persona=$1
title=$2
priority=${3:-MEDIUM}

cat > ".personas/project/todos/$persona/current/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-$title.md" << EOT
# $title

**Created:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Priority:** $priority
**Assigned:** $(echo $persona | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')

## Objective
[Describe what needs to be accomplished]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific criterion]

## Notes
[Additional context]
EOT
EOF

chmod +x .personas/tools/new-task.sh
```

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### GitHub Copilot Issues

**Issue: File Attachment Not Working**
```markdown
# Alternative methods:
1. Copy-paste content directly
2. Use "Add to Chat" button in VS Code
3. Reference files with @workspace tag
4. Use relative paths: @workspace /relative/path/to/file
```

**Issue: Context Lost During Session**
```markdown
# Recovery steps:
1. Re-attach persona instructions
2. Summarize previous work
3. Confirm persona understanding
4. Continue with task
```

#### ChatGPT Issues

**Issue: Context Length Limits**
```markdown
# Strategies:
1. Use condensed persona instructions
2. Break tasks into smaller pieces
3. Use conversation memory effectively
4. Start new conversations for complex tasks
```

#### Local LLM Issues

**Issue: Model Doesn't Understand Framework**
```markdown
# Fine-tuning approaches:
1. Include framework examples in training
2. Use few-shot learning with examples
3. Create framework-specific prompts
4. Train on persona interaction patterns
```
