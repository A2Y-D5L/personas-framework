# Implement Personas - Discrete Tasks

**Created:** August 27, 2025  
**Owner:** Agent Manager Persona  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ ACTIVE

## Problem Statement

The current `.agent` directory is too broad and overwhelming for agents to quickly orient and act effectively. The 296-line `AGENTS.md` file contains universal instructions that create cognitive overload. Persona-specific instruction files are mostly empty, missing the specialized guidance needed for focused agent work.

**Key Issues:**

- Persona instruction files are empty or minimal
- All agents receive the same overwhelming instruction set  
- No clear role separation or specialized priorities
- Context overload prevents quick orientation and action

## Solution: Refined Persona-Specific Instructions

Create focused, role-specific instruction sets that allow agents to quickly understand their role, priorities, and relevant context without information overload.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-2)

- Establish persona framework and Agent-Manager baseline
- Validate approach with current Agent-Manager workflows

### Phase 2: Core Personas (Tasks 3-5)

- Implement Engineer, Planner, and Reviewer personas in parallel
- Test persona-specific instructions with actual tasks

### Phase 3: Integration (Tasks 6-7)

- Implement context filtering and coordination protocols
- Validate persona interactions and handoffs

### Phase 4: Refinement (Task 8)

- Refactor AGENTS.md based on lessons learned
- Optimize for minimal cognitive load and maximum effectiveness

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals

- **Orientation Time:** <2 minutes for agents to understand their role and start work
- **Context Load:** <50 lines of essential instructions per persona
- **Handoff Efficiency:** <1 minute to transfer work between personas

### Qualitative Goals

- **Role Clarity:** Each agent clearly understands their specific responsibilities
- **Context Relevance:** Agents only see information relevant to their role
- **Coordination Smoothness:** Seamless handoffs between personas without confusion

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Over-Fragmentation

**Mitigation:** Maintain overlap documentation and clear escalation paths

### Risk: Context Loss

**Mitigation:** Cross-reference essential context across personas, preserve AGENTS.md as fallback

### Risk: Coordination Overhead

**Mitigation:** Keep handoff procedures lightweight, use templates for efficiency
