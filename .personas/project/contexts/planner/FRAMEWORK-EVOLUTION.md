# Framework Evolution Planning

**Context:** Meta-Planning for Personas Framework Architecture  
**Scope:** Planner-specific framework enhancement methodologies  
**Updated:** August 27, 2025

## Overview

This document provides planning methodologies and architectural patterns for evolving the Personas Framework. The framework requires specialized planning approaches when it is used to enhance itself through recursive development processes.

## Meta-Planning Architecture

### Framework Evolution Strategy

**Dual-Mode Planning:**

```text
Framework-as-Target ⟷ Framework-as-Tool
     ↓                       ↓
Architecture Planning    Planning Architecture
(What to enhance)       (How to enhance)
```

**Strategic Planning Layers:**

1. **Framework Core Evolution:** Changes to fundamental persona definitions
2. **Workflow Enhancement:** Improvements to coordination and handoff patterns
3. **Template Advancement:** Updates to project template structures
4. **Capability Expansion:** Addition of new framework features and patterns

### Recursive Planning Methodology

**Planning the Framework that Plans:**

The Planner persona must plan enhancements to its own planning capabilities:

```text
Current Planning Capability → Enhanced Planning Capability
         ↓                           ↓
   Plan Enhancement          Execute Enhancement
         ↓                           ↓
   Validate Enhancement      Deploy Enhancement
```

**Bootstrap Planning Process:**

1. **Capability Assessment:** Analyze current framework planning limitations
2. **Enhancement Design:** Design improvements using current planning capabilities
3. **Implementation Strategy:** Plan the implementation of planning improvements
4. **Validation Framework:** Plan how to validate planning enhancements

## Framework Architecture Principles

### Evolutionary Architecture Patterns

**Principle 1: Compositional Enhancement**
- New capabilities should compose with existing framework features
- Enhancements should not require wholesale framework replacement
- Changes should be additive rather than replacement-based

**Principle 2: Recursive Scalability**
- Framework improvements should improve the framework's ability to improve itself
- Meta-capabilities should enhance with each evolution cycle
- Self-improvement processes should compound over time

**Principle 3: Stability Under Change**
- Core persona coordination patterns should remain stable
- Directory structure changes should be migration-friendly
- Framework evolution should not break existing project workflows

**Principle 4: Observable Evolution**
- Framework changes should be trackable and auditable
- Enhancement outcomes should be measurable
- Evolution patterns should be documented and reusable

### Framework Design Patterns

**Pattern 1: Three-Tier Stability**

```text
Framework Core (Stable)
├── Universal persona definitions
├── Core coordination patterns
└── Fundamental workflow structures

Framework Templates (Evolutionary)
├── Project structure templates
├── Default configuration patterns
└── Best practice examples

Project Customizations (Dynamic)
├── Project-specific adaptations
├── Local workflow modifications
└── Domain-specific extensions
```

**Pattern 2: Capability Layering**

```text
Meta-Capabilities (Self-improvement)
├── Framework can enhance itself
├── Recursive development workflows
└── Bootstrap enhancement processes

Core Capabilities (Project coordination)
├── Persona-based task management
├── Cross-persona handoff protocols
└── Directory-based organization

Base Capabilities (File management)
├── Structured documentation
├── Template-based project setup
└── Version-controlled changes
```

**Enhancement Prioritization Framework:**

1. **Framework Health:** Fixes and improvements to core stability
2. **User Experience:** Enhancements that improve framework usability
3. **Capability Expansion:** New features that extend framework power
4. **Meta-Development:** Improvements to self-enhancement capabilities

### Planning Methodologies

**Recursive Planning Approach:**

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Assess framework's planning capabilities
   - Identify planning process limitations
   - Document current planning workflows

2. **Future State Design:**
   - Envision enhanced planning capabilities
   - Design improved planning processes
   - Plan the planning improvements

3. **Transition Strategy:**
   - Plan migration from current to future planning
   - Design implementation phases
   - Coordinate planning enhancement rollout

**Framework-Specific Planning Tools:**

```markdown
Planning Artifact Templates:

1. **Enhancement Specification:**
   - Capability description and requirements
   - Architecture impact and compatibility analysis
   - Implementation strategy and timeline

2. **Migration Plan:**
   - Current state to future state transition
   - Project compatibility and update requirements
   - Rollback strategy and risk mitigation

3. **Validation Strategy:**
   - Testing approach for framework changes
   - Quality gates and acceptance criteria
   - Performance and compatibility validation
```

## Architecture Decision Patterns

### Framework Architecture Decisions

**Decision Pattern 1: Enhancement Scope**

```markdown
Decision: Should enhancement be framework-core or project-optional?

Framework-Core Criteria:
- Universal applicability across project types
- Core to persona coordination patterns
- Required for framework integrity

Project-Optional Criteria:
- Domain-specific or project-type specific
- Optional workflow enhancements
- Can be adopted incrementally
```

**Decision Pattern 2: Implementation Strategy**

```markdown
Decision: Incremental vs. Wholesale enhancement?

Incremental Approach:
- Small, testable changes
- Gradual capability evolution
- Lower risk, slower progress

Wholesale Approach:
- Comprehensive capability overhaul
- Faster transformation
- Higher risk, coordination complexity
```

**Decision Pattern 3: Compatibility Strategy**

```markdown
Decision: Backwards compatibility vs. Clean break?

Backwards Compatible:
- Existing projects continue working
- Migration support provided
- Complexity increases over time

Clean Break:
- Simplified framework architecture
- Requires project migration
- Clear evolutionary step
```

### Planning Coordination Patterns

**Cross-Persona Planning Coordination:**

1. **Planner ↔ Engineer Coordination:**
   - Architecture decisions inform implementation planning
   - Implementation constraints influence architecture design
   - Iterative refinement of enhancement plans

2. **Planner ↔ Reviewer Coordination:**
   - Quality requirements influence architecture design
   - Architecture decisions inform validation strategy
   - Risk assessment shapes planning approach

3. **Planner ↔ Agent-Manager Coordination:**
   - Planning workflow coordination and management
   - Documentation and communication planning
   - Change management and rollout coordination

**Framework Planning Handoffs:**

```markdown
Planner → Engineer Handoff:
- Enhancement architecture and design
- Implementation requirements and constraints
- Quality and performance expectations
- Migration and compatibility requirements

Planner → Reviewer Handoff:
- Architecture review requirements
- Design validation criteria
- Risk assessment and mitigation plans
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
```

## Risk Management Patterns

### Framework Evolution Risks

**Risk Category 1: Framework Stability**
- Core persona coordination breakdown

- Workflow process failures

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Incremental change approaches

- Rollback capability maintenance

**Risk Category 2: Project Compatibility**
- Existing project workflow disruption
- Migration complexity and failure
- Backwards compatibility breaks

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Compatibility impact assessment
- Migration tool development

**Risk Category 3: Self-Reference Paradox**
- Framework cannot plan its own enhancement
- Circular dependency in planning process
- Bootstrap capability limitations

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- External validation processes
- Phased capability enhancement
- Alternative planning approaches

### Quality Assurance Planning

**Framework Enhancement Quality Gates:**

```markdown
Planning Quality Gates:

1. **Architecture Review Gate:**
