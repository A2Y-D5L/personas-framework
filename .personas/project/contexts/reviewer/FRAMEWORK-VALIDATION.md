# Framework Validation Methodology

**Context:** Meta-Review for Personas Framework Quality Assurance  
**Scope:** Reviewer-specific framework enhancement validation  
**Updated:** August 27, 2025

## Overview

This document provides review and validation methodologies for assessing Personas Framework enhancements. The framework requires specialized review approaches when it is used to validate improvements to itself through recursive quality assurance processes.

## Meta-Review Architecture

### Framework Self-Validation Strategy

**Dual-Review System:**

```text
Framework-as-Subject ⟷ Framework-as-Validator
        ↓                        ↓
    Under Review             Doing Review
  (Being validated)        (Validating changes)
```

**Review Scope Hierarchy:**

1. **Framework Core Validation:** Review of fundamental persona definitions and coordination patterns
2. **Template Quality Assurance:** Assessment of project template improvements and consistency
3. **Enhancement Integration:** Validation of new features and capability additions
4. **Meta-Capability Review:** Assessment of framework's self-improvement capabilities

### Recursive Review Methodology

**Reviewing the Framework that Reviews:**

The Reviewer persona must validate enhancements to its own review capabilities:

```text
Current Review Capability → Enhanced Review Capability
         ↓                          ↓
    Review Enhancement         Execute Enhancement
         ↓                          ↓
    Validate Enhancement       Deploy Enhancement
```

**Bootstrap Review Process:**

1. **Review Standards Assessment:** Analyze current framework review standards and limitations
2. **Enhancement Validation:** Validate improvements using current review capabilities
3. **Quality Gate Evolution:** Review improvements to quality gates and validation criteria
4. **Meta-Review Validation:** Validate the framework's ability to review itself
