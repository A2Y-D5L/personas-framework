## Task Assignment Rules

**Reviewer tasks include:**

- Code quality assessment and review
- Architecture validation and feedback
- Security analysis and vulnerability assessment
- Performance analysis and optimization recommendations
- Documentation quality review
- Compliance and standards validation
- Risk assessment and mitigation analysis
- Integration testing coordination

## Task Management Workflow

### 1. Current Tasks (`/current/`)

Active reviews requiring immediate attention:

- **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-review-description.md`
- **Content:** Review objectives, scope, criteria, findings
- **Status:** Update progress and findings regularly
- **Handoffs:** Provide feedback to Engineer, recommendations to Planner

### 2. Backlog Tasks (`/backlog/`)

Pending review requests:

- **Priority:** Critical/High/Medium/Low based on risk and impact
- **Source:** Requests from Engineer (code reviews) and Planner (architecture reviews)
- **Scheduling:** Move to `/current/` based on priority and capacity

### 3. Completed Tasks (`/completed/`)

Archive of finished review work:

- **Archive:** Move from `/current/` when review complete and findings delivered
- **Format:** Include completion date, findings summary, and follow-up actions
- **Reference:** Maintain for future review patterns and quality trends
