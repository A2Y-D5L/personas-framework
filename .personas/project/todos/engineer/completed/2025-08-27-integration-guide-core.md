# Integration Guide: Core Framework Setup

**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Assigned:** Engineer  
**Estimated Effort:** L  
**Related to:** User onboarding and framework adoption

## Objective
Create a comprehensive integration guide that enables users to quickly and successfully set up the Personas Framework in their new or existing projects. The guide should reduce friction and provide clear, actionable steps for framework adoption.

## Scope and Requirements

### Target Audience
- Developers integrating the framework into new projects
- Teams adopting the framework in existing codebases
- AI agents that need to understand framework setup

### Core Guide Requirements
- **Location:** `docs/integration-guide.md`
- **Format:** Markdown with clear section headers and navigation
- **Structure:** Progressive disclosure from quick start to advanced configuration
- **Examples:** Real-world examples for different project types

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Guide covers complete framework initialization process
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions for new project setup
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions for existing project integration
- [ ] Prerequisites and system requirements documented
- [ ] Common troubleshooting scenarios included
- [ ] Directory structure explanation with visual diagrams
- [ ] Integration examples for at least 3 project types (web app, CLI tool, library)
- [ ] Links to related documentation and quick references
- [ ] Validation steps to confirm successful setup

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Framework Analysis
1. Analyze existing setup.sh script functionality
2. Review current documentation gaps
3. Identify user pain points from existing quick-start guides
4. Map out integration workflows for different project types

### Phase 2: Content Creation
1. Create comprehensive outline with all required sections
2. Write content progressively from basic to advanced
3. Include real-world examples and code snippets
4. Add visual diagrams for directory structure

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Test setup procedures on clean environments
2. Validate instructions work for different project types
3. Ensure all links and references are correct
4. Test troubleshooting scenarios

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Link guide from main README.md
2. Update quick-reference.md with guide references
3. Ensure consistency with existing documentation
4. Add to table of contents and navigation

## Architectural Considerations

### User Experience
- Progressive disclosure: basic → intermediate → advanced
- Multiple entry points based on user experience level
- Clear success indicators at each step
- Minimal cognitive load for getting started

### Content Organization
- Scannable headings and structure
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Consistent formatting and terminology
- Cross-references to related documentation

### Maintenance
- Version compatibility notes
- Update procedures when framework changes
- Community contribution guidelines
- Feedback collection mechanisms

## Dependencies
- Existing setup.sh script functionality
- Current documentation structure in docs/
- Framework validation tools in tools/
- Project template structure in framework/project-template/

## Risk Assessment

### Content Risk
- **Risk:** Guide becomes outdated as framework evolves
- **Mitigation:** Include version compatibility notes and update procedures
- **Contingency:** Automated validation of guide steps in CI

### Usability Risk
- **Risk:** Guide too complex for quick adoption
- **Mitigation:** Multiple difficulty levels and clear section separation
- **Contingency:** User feedback collection and iterative improvement

### Technical Risk
- **Risk:** Setup instructions fail on different environments
- **Mitigation:** Test on multiple platforms and document environment-specific notes
- **Contingency:** Community-driven troubleshooting section

## Success Metrics
- Reduced setup time for new users (target: <15 minutes for basic setup)
- Decreased support questions about framework integration
- Increased framework adoption based on clear onboarding
- Positive feedback on guide usability and completeness

## Handoff Requirements

### To Reviewer
- Complete integration guide with all sections implemented
- Tested setup procedures on multiple project types
- Cross-referenced documentation for consistency
- Examples validated and working

### Documentation
- Guide integrated into docs/ directory structure
- Updated navigation and cross-references
- Version compatibility notes included
- Maintenance procedures documented

## Notes
- Consider creating video tutorials to supplement written guide
- Plan for localization if framework gains international adoption
- Design guide to be useful for both human users and AI agents
- Include framework philosophy and design principles for better understanding
