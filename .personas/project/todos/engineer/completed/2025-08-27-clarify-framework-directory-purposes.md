# Clarify Framework Directory Purposes in Persona Instructions

**Created:** August 27, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Assigned:** Engineer  
**Type:** Documentation Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

## Objective

Update all persona instruction files to clearly disambiguate the distinct purposes of `.personas/framework/personas`, `.personas/project/contexts`, and `.personas/project/todos` directories. This will eliminate confusion about where different types of content belong and improve framework usability.

## Problem Statement

The current persona instructions may not clearly distinguish between:

1. **Framework Personas Directory** (`.personas/framework/personas/`) - Universal persona definitions
2. **Project Contexts Directory** (`.personas/project/contexts/`) - Project-specific context and customizations
3. **Project Todos Directory** (`.personas/project/todos/`) - Active task management

This ambiguity can lead to:
- Confusion about where to place project-specific customizations
- Unclear understanding of which content is universal vs. project-specific
- Inefficient context discovery and usage
- Improper modification of framework files instead of project customizations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All persona instruction files clearly explain the three-tier directory structure
- [ ] Each directory's purpose is explicitly defined with examples
- [ ] Context hierarchy sections correctly reference appropriate directories
- [ ] Usage guidelines differentiate between framework and project content
- [ ] Examples demonstrate proper usage of each directory type
- [ ] Cross-references between directories are clearly explained
- [ ] Quick-start guides include directory purpose clarification

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Directory Purpose Analysis

**1.1 Define Clear Directory Purposes:**

**Framework Personas Directory (`.personas/framework/personas/`):**
- **Purpose:** Universal persona definitions and instructions
- **Content:** Core persona instructions, handoff protocols, universal workflows
- **Scope:** Project-agnostic, applies to all projects using the framework
- **Modification:** Should not be modified by individual projects
- **Updates:** Only updated when framework itself evolves

**Project Contexts Directory (`.personas/project/contexts/`):**
- **Purpose:** Project-specific context and persona customizations
- **Content:** Technology-specific patterns, domain knowledge, project standards
- **Scope:** Specific to individual project and team
- **Modification:** Actively customized and maintained by project teams
- **Updates:** Continuously updated as project evolves

**Project Todos Directory (`.personas/project/todos/`):**
- **Purpose:** Active task management and workflow coordination
- **Content:** Current tasks, backlog items, completed work archives
- **Scope:** Dynamic, day-to-day operational content
- **Modification:** Constantly updated as work progresses
- **Updates:** Real-time updates as tasks are created, worked on, and completed

### Phase 2: Update All Persona Instructions

**2.1 Engineer Persona Instructions Update:**

Add directory disambiguation section to `engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md`:

```markdown
## Framework Directory Structure

The Personas Framework uses a three-tier directory structure with distinct purposes:

```

### Phase 3: Update Context Hierarchy References

**3.1 Standardize Context Hierarchy Sections:**

Ensure all personas use consistent context hierarchy that clearly references:

```markdown
## Context Hierarchy

### Priority 1: Framework Understanding (Read-Only Reference)
1. **Universal Persona Definition**
   - `.personas/framework/personas/[persona]/INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Core persona responsibilities and methodologies
   - Universal workflows, handoff protocols, and standard procedures
   - Project-agnostic best practices and quality standards

### Priority 2: Project Adaptation (Actively Customize)
1. **Project-Specific Context**
   - `.personas/project/contexts/[persona]/` - Project-specific adaptations and customizations
   - Technology-specific patterns, domain knowledge, and project standards
   - Team-specific processes and customized workflows

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - `.personas/project/TECH-SPEC.md` - Project architecture and technical requirements
   - `.personas/project/STANDARDS.md` - Project coding standards and conventions
   - `.personas/project/DEPENDENCIES.md` - External dependencies and constraints

### Priority 3: Active Work Execution (Continuously Update)
1. **Current Tasks and Workflow**
   - `.personas/project/todos/[persona]/current/` - Active tasks requiring immediate attention
   - Specific task acceptance criteria and implementation requirements
   - Dependencies and coordination requirements with other personas

2. **Work History and Planning**
   - `.personas/project/todos/[persona]/backlog/` - Planned future work and initiatives
   - `.personas/project/todos/[persona]/completed/` - Historical work and outcomes
   - Pattern analysis and lessons learned from previous tasks
```

### Phase 4: Update Quick-Start Guides

**4.1 Add Directory Orientation to All Quick-Start Guides:**

Add consistent section to all `QUICK-START.md` files:

```markdown
## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Orientation

Before starting, understand the three-tier structure:

**üèóÔ∏è Framework (`.personas/framework/personas/[persona]/`):**
- Universal persona definition - read this first
- Project-agnostic best practices and methodologies
- Standard workflows and handoff protocols
- **Do not modify** - these are framework definitions

**üéØ Project Context (`.personas/project/contexts/[persona]/`):**
- Project-specific customizations and adaptations
- Technology and domain-specific patterns
- **Actively customize** for your project needs
- Update as your project evolves

**üìã Project Todos (`.personas/project/todos/[persona]/`):**
- Active task management and workflow execution
- Current work, planned initiatives, completed tasks
- **Continuously update** as work progresses
- Reflects real-time project state

### Getting Started Flow

1. **üìñ Read Framework Instructions:** Understand your persona's universal responsibilities
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Customize Project Context:** Adapt patterns and practices for your project
3. **üöÄ Execute via Todos:** Create and manage tasks for actual work
```

### Phase 5: Update Framework Documentation

**5.1 Update Main Framework Documentation:**

Add directory purpose clarification to `PERSONA-FRAMEWORK.md`:

```markdown
## Directory Structure and Purposes

The Personas Framework uses a three-tier architecture that separates universal definitions, project-specific adaptations, and active work management:

### Framework Tier: Universal Definitions
**Location:** `.personas/framework/personas/`

- **Purpose:** Project-agnostic persona definitions and methodologies
- **Content:** Universal instructions, workflows, and best practices
- **Maintenance:** Updated only when framework itself evolves
- **Usage:** Read-only reference for understanding persona responsibilities

### Project Tier: Specific Adaptations
**Location:** `.personas/project/contexts/` and `.personas/project/`

- **Purpose:** Project-specific customizations and adaptations
- **Content:** Technology patterns, domain knowledge, project standards
- **Maintenance:** Actively maintained and customized by project teams
- **Usage:** Tailored to specific project, technology stack, and team needs

### Operational Tier: Active Work Management
**Location:** `.personas/project/todos/`

- **Purpose:** Dynamic task management and workflow coordination
- **Content:** Current tasks, planned work, completed outcomes
- **Maintenance:** Continuously updated as work progresses
- **Usage:** Real-time operational coordination and task execution

This separation ensures that universal framework knowledge remains consistent while enabling extensive project-specific customization and efficient operational management.
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low-Risk Implementation

**This enhancement is low-risk because:**
- Pure documentation improvement with no functional changes
- Clarifies existing structure rather than changing it
- Improves user understanding and framework adoption
- No impact on existing workflows or tools

### Potential Benefits

**1. Improved Framework Adoption:**
- Clearer understanding leads to better usage
- Reduced confusion during initial setup
- More effective project customization

**2. Better Framework Maintenance:**
- Clear separation prevents inappropriate modifications
- Project teams understand customization boundaries
- Framework updates don't conflict with project customizations
