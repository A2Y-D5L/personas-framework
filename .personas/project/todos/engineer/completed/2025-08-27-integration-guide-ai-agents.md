### Integration Methods

#### 1. GitHub Copilot Chat Integration

**Method 1: Direct File Attachment**
```markdown
# In GitHub Copilot Chat:
@workspace /attach .personas/framework/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md

You are now acting as the Engineer persona from the Personas Framework. 
Please review your instructions and begin working on [specific task].
```

**Method 2: Context Loading Prompt**
```markdown
# Copy-paste approach for platforms without file attachment
Please assume the role of the Engineer persona from the Personas Framework.
Here are your instructions: [paste INSTRUCTIONS.md content]

Focus on: [specific area of work]
Current task: [specific task description]
```

#### 2. VS Code Agent Mode Integration

**Workflow Setup:**
1. Open persona INSTRUCTIONS.md in VS Code
2. Use "Add to Chat" or attach to agent context
3. Initialize agent with persona assumption prompt
4. Reference project-specific context from `.personas/project/contexts/[persona]/`

#### 3. CLI and Automation Integration

**Script Template:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Persona-aware automation script
PERSONA_TYPE=${1:-engineer}
PERSONA_INSTRUCTIONS=".personas/framework/personas/$PERSONA_TYPE/INSTRUCTIONS.md"
PROJECT_CONTEXT=".personas/project/contexts/$PERSONA_TYPE/"

# Load persona context and execute task
ai-tool --context "$PERSONA_INSTRUCTIONS" --project-context "$PROJECT_CONTEXT" --task "$2"
```

You are now the Engineer persona from the Personas Framework. 
Review your instructions and assume this role for our development session.

# Step 3: Load project context
@workspace /attach .personas/project/contexts/engineer/

# Step 4: Start work
Please review the current tasks in .personas/project/todos/engineer/current/ 
and begin implementation of the highest priority item.
```

### Example 2: Planner Architecture Session

```markdown
# Step 1: Assume planner role
You are the Planner persona. Your role is architecture and roadmapping.
[Attach .personas/framework/personas/planner/INSTRUCTIONS.md]

# Step 2: Review project requirements
Please analyze the technical requirements in .personas/project/TECH-SPEC.md
and create an implementation plan.

# Step 3: Break down tasks
Create specific engineering tasks based on your analysis and place them
in the appropriate engineer todo directories.
