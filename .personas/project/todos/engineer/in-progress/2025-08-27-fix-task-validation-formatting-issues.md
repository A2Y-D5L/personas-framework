# Fix Task Validation Issues and Formatting

**Created:** August 27, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Assigned:** Engineer  
**Review Type:** Follow-up from completed task review  

## Objective

3. **Placeholder Content:** Completed tasks still contain placeholder text
4. **Priority Format Issues:** Task priorities should be HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW format
5. **Naming Convention Violations:** Some tasks don't follow YYYY-MM-DD-description.md pattern

## Current Issues Summary

From validation output:
- **50 total warnings** across 9 task files
- **Missing Objective sections** in completed tasks
