# Framework Adoption Strategy

**Created:** August 27, 2025  
**Owner:** Planner  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** üîÑ ACTIVE

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive strategy for adopting the personas framework across different types of software projects and development organizations.

## Background

The personas framework has been successfully self-implemented but needs strategic planning for broader adoption. This requires analyzing different project contexts, team structures, and integration patterns.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Type Analysis ‚è≥ PENDING

**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** Medium

**Objective:** Create taxonomy of project types and their persona framework adaptation needs

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Analyze common project types (web apps, APIs, libraries, data pipelines)
- [ ] Identify persona customization patterns per project type
- [ ] Create adaptation templates for major project categories
- [ ] Document persona role variations by project context

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Project type taxonomy with 5-8 categories documented
- [ ] Customization guidelines for each project type
- [ ] Template variations created and tested

### 2. Team Scaling Architecture ‚è≥ PENDING

**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** Large

**Objective:** Design framework scaling from individual developers to large teams

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Analyze coordination patterns for teams of 2-3, 4-8, 9-20+ developers  
- [ ] Design persona specialization strategies for larger teams
- [ ] Plan integration with existing development workflows
- [ ] Create cross-team coordination protocols

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Scaling architecture supports 1-20+ developers
- [ ] Clear specialization and coordination patterns documented
- [ ] Integration guides for common development tools created

### 3. Migration Planning ‚è≥ PENDING

**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** Medium

**Objective:** Create systematic migration plans for existing projects

**Deliverables:**

- [ ] Design phased adoption strategy (pilot ‚Üí partial ‚Üí full)
- [ ] Create risk assessment framework for migrations
- [ ] Plan rollback strategies and contingency procedures
- [ ] Develop success metrics and validation criteria

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] 3-phase migration strategy documented
- [ ] Risk mitigation plans for common migration scenarios
- [ ] Success metrics and KPIs defined

## Dependencies

- Framework validation with external test projects
- Feedback from early adopter organizations
- Integration testing with popular development tools

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear adoption strategy for different project types
- [ ] Scalable architecture supports various team sizes
- [ ] Systematic migration approach reduces adoption friction
- [ ] Framework demonstrates measurable value across multiple contexts

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk:** Framework too complex for small projects  
**Mitigation:** Create simplified "lite" versions with essential personas only

**Risk:** Integration friction with existing workflows  
**Mitigation:** Develop adapters and integration guides for popular tools (GitHub, Jira, etc.)

**Risk:** Coordination overhead outweighs productivity benefits  
**Mitigation:** Measure efficiency gains and optimize coordination protocols

## Next Steps

1. Begin with project type analysis to understand adaptation patterns
2. Create pilot implementation with 2-3 different project types
3. Gather feedback and refine scaling architecture
4. Develop comprehensive migration toolkit
