# Personas Framework Technical Specification

**Project:** Personas Framework  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Updated:** August 27, 2025

## Project Overview

The Personas Framework is a coordination system that organizes development work through specialized agent roles (personas). It reduces cognitive overload by providing focused, role-specific instructions and context hierarchies.

## Architecture

### System Components

**Framework Core:**
- Persona instruction files with role definitions and workflows
- TODO management system with current/backlog/completed organization
- Context filtering and priority hierarchies
- Handoff protocols between personas

**Project Integration:**
- Project template with customizable specifications
- Two-tier TODO system (framework + project level)
- Persona-specific context directories
- Integration with existing development workflows

### Core Concepts

**Persona:** A specialized agent role with focused responsibilities, clear scope boundaries, and specific workflow patterns.

**Context Hierarchy:** Priority-ordered information delivery to reduce cognitive load and enable quick orientation.

**Handoff Protocol:** Standardized process for transferring work between personas with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.

**Two-Tier System:** Separation between framework coordination tasks and project implementation tasks.
