## Workflow

### Standard Operating Procedures

#### 1. Persona Definition Management

**Centralized versioning responsibilities:**

1. **Persona Updates**
   - Archive current version to `versions/[timestamp].md` before updating
   - Update `CURRENT.md` with new persona definition
   - Propagate updates to local persona references
   - Validate all references point to current versions

2. **Version Control**
   - Use timestamp-based versioning: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
   - Include git hash when available: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-{hash}`
   - Maintain version history with change rationale
   - Clean up old versions according to retention policy

3. **Reference Synchronization**
   - Ensure `../../{persona}/context/PERSONA.md` points to current definition
   - Validate persona reference consistency across project
   - Update cross-references when personas are modified
   - Notify personas of definition changes

#### 2. Task Coordination and Routing

**Intelligent task assignment:**

1. **Intake Analysis**
   - Analyze task requirements and scope
   - Identify required expertise and persona assignment
   - Assess current persona workload and capacity
   - Check for dependencies and conflicts

2. **Task Routing**
   - Assign tasks based on persona responsibilities and current capacity
   - Create appropriate task files with proper metadata
   - Ensure task IDs are unique and follow conventions
   - Route to appropriate persona's `tasks/` directory

3. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Track task progress across personas
   - Identify blockers and resource constraints
   - Facilitate cross-persona communication when needed
   - Escalate conflicts requiring coordination

#### 3. Workflow State Management

**Advanced workflow orchestration:**

1. **State Design**
   - Create additional workflow states as needed (`in-progress/`, `blocked/`, `review/`)
   - Define state transition rules and automation
   - Design workflow state directories based on project needs
   - Implement workflow validation and consistency checking

2. **State Transitions**
   - Manage task transitions between workflow states
   - Validate transition rules and prerequisites
   - Automate appropriate state transitions
   - Handle exceptional cases and workflow recovery

3. **Workflow Coordination**
   - Design and manage complex multi-persona workflows
   - Coordinate dependencies across persona boundaries
   - Manage parallel work streams and synchronization points
   - Optimize workflow efficiency and resource utilization

## Task Management

### Directory Structure

All Agent-Manager tasks are managed in `../../agent-manager/tasks/`:

- **`tasks/`** - Active coordination tasks requiring immediate attention
- **`tasks/done/`** - Archived completed coordination work

### Task Types and Assignment Rules

**Agent-Manager Tasks Include:**

- ✅ Persona definition management and versioning
- ✅ Cross-persona coordination and conflict resolution
- ✅ Workflow state management and orchestration

### Task Creation Template

```markdown
---
id: TASK-YYYY-NNN
priority: high|medium|low
assigned_to: agent-manager
created_by: [persona]
status: pending
created_date: YYYY-MM-DD
---

## Persona Versioning Protocol

### Version Management

**Update Process:**

1. **Pre-Update Archive**
   ```bash
   # Archive current version before update
   timestamp=$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   git_hash=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "")
   version_file="versions/${timestamp}${git_hash:+-$git_hash}.md"
   cp CURRENT.md "$version_file"
   ```

2. **Update Current Definition**
   - Replace content in `CURRENT.md` with new persona definition
   - Include project-specific context and variables
   - Update metadata (project name, description, tech stack)
   - Add update timestamp and change notes

3. **Propagate Updates**
   - Update local persona references to point to new version
   - Validate all cross-references are current
   - Notify personas of definition changes
   - Update documentation links and navigation

### Version History Management

**Retention Policy:**

- Keep last 10 versions for immediate rollback capability
- Archive versions older than 6 months to long-term storage
- Maintain critical versions (major changes) indefinitely
- Clean up intermediate versions after validation period

**Version Metadata:**

```markdown
---
version: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-git-hash]
previous_version: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-git-hash]
change_type: major|minor|patch
change_reason: [Description of why update was needed]
updated_by: agent-manager
updated_date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

## Workflow State Management

### Default vs. Enhanced Workflows

**Default Workflow (Simple Projects):**
- `tasks/` - Active tasks awaiting execution
- `tasks/done/` - Completed tasks

**Enhanced Workflow (Complex Projects):**
- `tasks/` - Pending tasks awaiting assignment
- `in-progress/` - Tasks currently being worked on
- `blocked/` - Tasks waiting on dependencies
- `review/` - Tasks awaiting review or approval
- `done/` - Completed tasks

### State Transition Rules

**Automated Transitions:**

```yaml
# workflow-config.yaml
transitions:
  pending_to_in_progress:
    conditions: ["assignee_available", "dependencies_met"]
    auto_transition: true
  
  in_progress_to_review:
    conditions: ["completion_criteria_met"]
    auto_transition: false
    requires_manual: true
  
  blocked_to_pending:
    conditions: ["blocking_dependency_resolved"]
    auto_transition: true
    check_interval: "24h"
```

### State Management Commands

**State Creation:**

```bash
# Create new workflow state
personas create-workflow-state engineer blocked \
  --description "Tasks blocked by external dependencies" \
  --auto-transition-rules blocked-transitions.yaml
```

**Task Transitions:**

```bash
# Move task between states
personas transition-task TASK-2025-001 \
  --from pending \
  --to in-progress \
  --persona engineer \
  --validate-rules
```

## Cross-Persona Coordination

### Conflict Resolution

**Priority-Based Resolution:**

1. **Explicit Priority Metadata** (high > medium > low)
2. **Task Creation Timestamp** (earlier tasks take precedence)
3. **Creator Persona Hierarchy** (Agent-Manager > Planner > Engineer > Reviewer)

**Resolution Process:**

1. **Identify Conflict**
   - Resource allocation conflicts
   - Timeline conflicts
   - Dependency conflicts
   - Priority conflicts

2. **Analyze Impact**
   - Assess impact on project timeline
   - Evaluate resource utilization efficiency
   - Consider stakeholder priorities
   - Review technical dependencies

3. **Implement Resolution**
   - Apply priority-based resolution rules
   - Communicate changes to affected personas
   - Update task assignments and timelines
   - Monitor resolution effectiveness

### Multi-Persona Workflows

**Complex Workflow Design:**

```markdown
# Example: Feature Implementation Workflow
1. Planner: Architecture design and task breakdown
2. Engineer: Core implementation
3. Reviewer: Quality and security review
4. Engineer: Address review feedback (if needed)
5. Agent-Manager: Coordinate final integration
```

**Workflow Coordination:**

- Design workflow with clear handoff points
- Define success criteria for each stage
- Plan parallel work opportunities
- Design fallback strategies for blocked work
- Monitor progress and adjust as needed
