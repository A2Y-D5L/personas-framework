# Persona Framework for go-stream Agent System

**Created:** August 27, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Define specialized agent personas for focused, efficient work

## Framework Overview

The go-stream project uses a persona-based agent system to reduce cognitive overload and improve task efficiency. Instead of all agents receiving the same overwhelming instruction set, each persona has specialized responsibilities and focused context.

### Core Principles

1. **Role Clarity:** Each persona has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
2. **Context Filtering:** Personas only receive information relevant to their role
3. **Efficient Handoffs:** Clear protocols for transferring work between personas
4. **Quick Orientation:** <2 minutes for agents to understand their role and start work
5. **Persona-Specific TODOs:** Each persona manages their own task backlog with agent-manager coordination

## TODO Management Framework

### Persona-Specific TODO Structure

Each persona maintains their own TODO list in their directory:

```text
.personas/framework/personas/
├── engineer/todos/
│   ├── current/
│   ├── backlog/
│   └── completed/
├── planner/todos/
│   ├── current/
│   ├── backlog/
│   └── completed/
├── reviewer/todos/
│   ├── current/
│   ├── backlog/
│   └── completed/
└── agent-manager/todos/
    ├── current/
    ├── coordination/  # Meta-tasks requiring cross-persona work
    ├── backlog/
    └── completed/
```

### TODO Assignment Rules

**Direct Assignment:**

- **Engineer TODOs:** Implementation, debugging, testing, optimization tasks
- **Planner TODOs:** Architecture design, task breakdown, dependency analysis
- **Reviewer TODOs:** Code review, quality assessment, security analysis
- **Agent-Manager TODOs:** Documentation maintenance, archival, persona coordination

**Meta-Task Coordination:**

- Tasks requiring multiple personas go to Agent-Manager's `coordination/` directory
- Agent-Manager breaks down and assigns sub-tasks to appropriate personas
- Cross-persona dependencies are tracked in Agent-Manager TODOs

**Context Priority:**

1. Personal TODO tasks (`personas/reviewer/todos/current/`)
2. Code analysis and review documents (`analysis/`)
3. Technical specifications for compliance checking
4. Current implementation state vs. requirements
5. Historical issues and quality patterns

---

### 🗂️ Agent-Manager Persona

**Primary Role:** Coordination and maintenance  
**Focus:** Organization, documentation, archival, coordination  
**Trigger:** "organize", "archive", "update docs", "housekeeping", "coordinate"

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Maintain `.personas/framework` directory organization
- Manage documentation lifecycle and archival
- Validate and organize TODO tasks across all personas
- Coordinate between personas and route tasks
- Preserve historical content and knowledge
- Manage meta-tasks requiring cross-persona coordination

**Context Priority:**

1. Personal TODO tasks (`personas/agent-manager/todos/current/`)
2. Cross-persona coordination tasks (`personas/agent-manager/todos/coordination/`)
3. Organization docs and housekeeping status
4. Archive procedures and historical content
5. All persona TODO states for coordination

---

## Role Boundaries and Interactions

### Clear Boundaries

| Persona | DOES | DOES NOT |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Engineer** | Implements code, writes tests, debugs | Architecture planning, code review |
| **Planner** | Designs architecture, breaks down tasks | Implementation details, code writing |
| **Reviewer** | Analyzes quality, reviews code | Implementation work, planning |
| **Agent-Manager** | Organizes docs, coordinates | Technical implementation, design |

### Handoff Triggers

**Planner → Engineer:**

- Task breakdown complete with acceptance criteria
- Architecture decisions documented
- Dependencies identified and resolved

**Engineer → Reviewer:**

- Implementation complete and tested
- Code ready for quality assessment
- Documentation updated

**Reviewer → Engineer:**

- Issues identified with specific fixes needed
- Quality standards not met
- Performance problems found

**Any Persona → Agent-Manager:**

- Documentation needs updating or archiving
- TODO tasks need validation or organization
- Cross-persona coordination required

## Instruction Template Structure

Each persona's `INSTRUCTIONS.md` follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Persona Name] Instructions

## Role Definition
- Primary responsibilities
- Scope boundaries
- Success criteria

## Workflow
- Standard operating procedures
- Decision-making framework
- Quality gates

## Context Hierarchy
- Priority 1: Essential documents
- Priority 2: Supporting context
- Priority 3: Background information

## Handoff Protocols
- When to hand off work
- Required deliverables for handoffs
- Communication templates

## Quick Start
- Essential context links
- Common task patterns
- Emergency procedures
```

---

## Coordination Protocols

### Communication Standards

**Handoff Documentation:**

- Clear deliverable description
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Relevant context linked
- Next steps outlined

**Status Updates:**

- Progress indicators (🔄 Active, ✅ Complete, ⚠️ Blocked)
- Blocker identification and escalation
- Timeline estimates and dependencies

### Escalation Paths

**Level 1:** Peer persona consultation
**Level 2:** Agent-Manager coordination
**Level 3:** Human escalation via documentation

### Quality Gates

Each handoff includes:

- [ ] Deliverable meets acceptance criteria
- [ ] Context provided for next persona
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Follow-up tasks identified

---

## Context Filtering System

### Persona-Specific Context Tags

Documents should be tagged for persona relevance:

- `#engineer-priority` - Essential for implementation work
- `#planner-priority` - Essential for architecture and planning
- `#reviewer-priority` - Essential for quality and analysis
- `#manager-priority` - Essential for organization and coordination
- `#cross-persona` - Relevant to multiple personas

### Context Hierarchy Rules

**Primary Context:** Must be reviewed before starting work
**Secondary Context:** Should be reviewed for complex tasks
**Background Context:** Available for reference as needed

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals

- **Orientation Time:** <2 minutes to understand role and start work
- **Context Load:** <50 lines of essential instructions per persona
- **Handoff Efficiency:** <1 minute to transfer work between personas

### Qualitative Goals

- **Role Clarity:** Agents clearly understand their specific responsibilities
- **Context Relevance:** Agents only see information relevant to their role
- **Coordination Smoothness:** Seamless handoffs without confusion

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Persona Instruction Authors

1. **Focus on Essentials:** Include only information critical for the role
2. **Use Action-Oriented Language:** Clear verbs and specific outcomes
3. **Provide Context Hierarchy:** Priority order for information consumption
4. **Define Clear Boundaries:** What the persona does and doesn't do
5. **Include Quick Start:** Essential context for immediate productivity

### For Agents Using Personas

1. **Start with Role Definition:** Understand your specific responsibilities
2. **Follow Context Hierarchy:** Review priority information first
3. **Respect Boundaries:** Hand off work outside your scope
4. **Document Handoffs:** Provide clear context for the next persona
5. **Update Status:** Keep documentation current for coordination

---

## Framework Evolution

This framework will evolve based on:

- Agent feedback and usage patterns
- Task completion efficiency metrics
- Coordination effectiveness
- Context relevance assessments

**Next Review:** After implementation of all core personas (Tasks 2-5)

## Quick Navigation

- **Agent-Manager:** [`/personas/agent-manager/INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./agent-manager/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **Engineer:** [`/personas/engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./engineer/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **Planner:** [`/personas/planner/INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./planner/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **Reviewer:** [`/personas/reviewer/INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./reviewer/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Emergency Fallback:** If persona selection is unclear, default to Agent-Manager for task routing.
