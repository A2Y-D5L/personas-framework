‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ completed/   # Archived completed plans
```

## Task Assignment Rules

**Planner tasks include:**

- Architecture design and system planning
- Feature roadmapping and breakdown
- Risk assessment and dependency analysis
- Performance and scalability planning
- Integration planning with external systems
- Resource estimation and timeline development
- Technical specification creation
- Migration and deployment planning

## Task Management Workflow

### 1. Current Tasks (`/current/`)

Active tasks requiring immediate attention:

- **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-task-description.md`
- **Content:** Planning objectives, constraints, deliverables
- **Status:** Update progress regularly
- **Handoffs:** Coordinate with Engineer for implementation, Reviewer for validation

### 2. Backlog Tasks (`/backlog/`)

Future planning needs:

- **Priority:** High/Medium/Low based on project needs
- **Dependencies:** Map to current development priorities
- **Scheduling:** Move to `/current/` when ready to begin

### 3. Completed Tasks (`/completed/`)

Archive of finished planning work:

- **Archive:** Move from `/current/` when objectives met
- **Format:** Include completion date and outcomes
- **Reference:** Maintain for future planning decisions

## Coordination with Other Personas

### üèóÔ∏è Engineer Handoffs

**From Planner to Engineer:**

- Detailed implementation plans
- Technical specifications
- Architecture diagrams and constraints
- Performance requirements

**From Engineer to Planner:**

- Implementation feedback
- Technical constraint discoveries
- Architecture modification requests
- Resource requirement updates

### üîç Reviewer Handoffs

**From Planner to Reviewer:**

- Architecture review requests
- Risk assessment validation
- Compliance analysis needs
- Quality criteria establishment

**From Reviewer to Planner:**

- Architecture feedback
- Risk mitigation recommendations
- Specification clarifications
- Quality improvement suggestions

### üóÇÔ∏è Agent-Manager Coordination

**Meta-tasks in `agent-manager/todos/coordination/`:**

- Cross-persona planning coordination
- Resource allocation decisions
- Timeline synchronization
- Priority conflict resolution
