## Escalation Patterns

### Level 1: Technical Consultation

**When to Escalate to Planner:**

- Integration decisions impact system design
- Performance requirements conflict with design constraints

**When to Escalate to Reviewer:**

- Implementation complexity requires design review
- Security implications need expert assessment
- Code quality concerns beyond implementation scope
- Performance characteristics need validation

### Level 2: Scope Clarification

**When Requirements are Unclear:**

1. Document specific areas of uncertainty
2. Provide implementation alternatives with trade-offs
3. Request clarification from Planner persona
4. Propose reasonable defaults with rationale

### Level 3: Technical Blockers

**When Implementation is Blocked:**

1. Document the specific blocker and its impact
2. Research and propose alternative approaches
3. Estimate effort for different resolution paths
4. Escalate to Agent-Manager for coordination if needed
